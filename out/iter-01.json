    "answer": "- Ralph loop is an iterative context analysis system that uses a persistent javascript runtime session where variables and state persist across iterations\n- RLM (Runtime Language Model) provides helper APIs including llmQuery() for semantic analysis and sub-LM queries within the javascript runtime environment\n- The Ralph loop explores context first, then plans chunking strategies, uses code for structural work, and leverages RLM for semantic interpretation\n- Together they enable interactive exploration and transformation of context through iterative steps, with RLM handling semantic queries while Ralph manages the iterative workflow\n- The system builds up answers in variables across iterations, using RLM's llmQuery API to process chunks of context semantically- Ralph loop is an outer iterate-until-pass loop that generates outputs, validates them with deterministic checks, and feeds back failures as constraints for the next attempt\n- RLM (Recursive Language Model) handles long context by treating documents as environments, loading them into sandboxed runtimes and analyzing with code rather than stuffing everything into prompts\n- Ralph loop keeps progress in artifacts like files, diffs, and logs rather than relying on the model's short-term memory, continuing until checks pass or budget is hit\n- RLM reduces context window pressure, context rot, and cost by fetching only needed slices and calling smaller LLM queries (llmQuery) when semantic understanding is required\n- Together, Ralph loop provides convergence through repeated validation while RLM provides scalability for inspecting large context programmatically\n- The combination works like CI for reasoning: generators write artifacts, validators act as tests, and failures become input for the next iteration",
